1. Drop your files in the proper group folder, if your group doesn't have a folder you can create one. (use snake case ie. `your_group`)
2. Run `python layout.py` in the root folder so the links get generated
3. Push your changes to main and use the generated links to reference your assets in the [Group Manager](https://github.com/infinity-MSFS/group-manager)
